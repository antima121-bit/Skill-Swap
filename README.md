Features: 1-Basic info: Name, location (optional), profile photo (optional)

2-List of skills offered

3-List of skills wanted

4-Availability (e.g., weekends, evenings)

5-Users can make their profile public or private.

6-Users can browse or search others by skill (e.g., "Photoshop" or "Excel")

7-Request & Accept Swaps:

Accept or reject swap offers
Show current and pending swap requests
8-Ratings or feedback after a swap

9-The user can also delete the swap request if it is not accepted.

Admin Role:

1-Reject inappropriate or spammy skill descriptions. 2-Ban users who violate platform policies. 3-Monitor pending, accepted, or cancelled swaps. 4-Send platform-wide messages (e.g., feature updates, downtime alerts). Download reports of user activity, feedback logs, and swap stats.
